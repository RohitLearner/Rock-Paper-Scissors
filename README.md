This repository contains my solution approach from the  [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/) Machine Learning with Python Project - [Rock Paper Scissor](https://www.kaggle.com/mohansacharya/graduate-admissions) challenge. ( ⭐️ Star repo on GitHub — it helps! )

For this challenge, you will create a program to play Rock, Paper, Scissors. A program that picks at random will usually win 50% of the time. To pass this challenge your program must play matches against four different bots, winning at least 60% of the games in each match.

You can start your access to this challenge via [the full project description and starter code on repl.it](https://repl.it/github/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-rock-paper-scissors).

After going to that link, fork the project and HAPPY CODING !!!
