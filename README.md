This repository contains my solution approach from the  [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/) Machine Learning with Python Project - [Rock Paper Scissor](https://www.kaggle.com/mohansacharya/graduate-admissions) challenge. ( ⭐️ Star repo on GitHub — it helps! )

For this challenge, you will create a program to play Rock, Paper, Scissors. A program that picks at random will usually win 50% of the time. To pass this challenge your program must play matches against four different bots, winning at least 60% of the games in each match.

You can start your access to this challenge via [the full project description and starter code on repl.it](https://repl.it/github/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-rock-paper-scissors).

After going to that link, fork the project and "HAPPY CODING" !!!

## Code
All different solution approaches are stored in `solution` folder. All code section are in `code` folder and the detailed description of the data can be found in [Repl.it](https://repl.it/@rohitsingh28/boilerplate-rock-paper-scissors#README.md).

To run the project, do the following steps:

 1. Dowload the Repo.
 2. Move to Code Portion
 3. `python3 main.py`
 4. `python3 test_module.py`
 5. Check if win rate against all players is more than 60%.
 6. Following output should be present in the end.
